# PyCommandRunner

The idea behind this project emerged from the lack of a REST client in Neovim. Over time, the concept evolved into creating a library that can execute text files using various runners. The architecture is designed to effortlessly incorporate additional runners, parse them, and utilize common variables across protocols.

# ToDo

## Features

- **Multiple Protocols**: Supports HTTP, RPC, WebSockets, Python executions, and more.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily add new runners and protocols.
- **Common Variables**: Use variables across different protocols to maintain consistency.
- **Neovim Integration**: Seamless integration with Neovim for executing commands directly from the editor.
- **Custom Parsers**: Write custom parsers to handle specific formats or protocols.
